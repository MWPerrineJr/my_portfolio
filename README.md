Hello my name is Michael Perrine and I am graduating from Bellevue University with a masters degree in data science. 
This portfolio encompasses the body of work that I've compiled during my 1 1/2 years as a student. My goal is to create a portfolio of 
realistic use cases to show case my skills as a data scientist. The portfolio is an evolving body of work that will showcase a variety of 
use cases. I welcome feedback on ways to improve my work. Thank you for viewing my portfolio.
